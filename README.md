# Paolo Bernardi Software Workshop

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm Paolo, an Italian software engineer, [member A1364](https://www.ordingtr.it/author/brnpla82a16f457a/) of the Italian  Institution of Engineers â€“ Province of Terni, Section A (senior), sector C (information engineering).

While most of my work pertains closed source software, every now and then I create code that I can share in the open without being sued or ashamed: this is what my GitHub space is about. Here you will find some absolutely indespensable, highly-customized utilities that I couldn't refrain from creating. Everyone has needs, after all.

By the way, Paolo Bernardi Software Workshop is how I brand my freelance software engineering job: if you need a professional consultancy <a href="https://www.bernardi.cloud/#call-to-action">feel free to get in touch</a>.

## My repositories ðŸ”­

While I'm definitely a computer-programming language polyglot, my open code is mostly written in Python, because I find it to be the best tool to get quick results in my scarce spare time.

Here's a selection of my Python open software:
  * [Photocopieuse](https://github.com/bernarpa/photocopieuse), a "personal assistent" that takes care of my Jira, Confluence, calendar etc.
  * [PBOTS](https://github.com/bernarpa/pbots), a tool to monitor online bulletin boards and notify changes via email.
  * [Lilium](https://github.com/bernarpa/lilium), a dashboard for my domestic monitoring appliances.
  * [Hugo Uploader](https://github.com/bernarpa/hugo-uploader), a command line FTP differential uploader for Hugo-based websites.

Other notable non-Python tools:
  * [PDF Juggler](https://github.com/bernarpa/pdfjuggler), a simple desktop tool written in Java to remix and reorder PDF files.
  * [Photo](https://github.com/bernarpa/photo), a command line tool written in Go to manage my photo library.
  * [PAES](https://github.com/bernarpa/PAES), a parallel OpenCL AES implementation.
  * [Little](https://github.com/bernarpa/Little), a simple imperative programming language interpreter written in C with a Literate Programming approach (I've used [nuweb](http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/)).
  * [OpenCV Slideshow](https://github.com/bernarpa/OpenCV-slideshow), a slide changer that works by showing [a green glove](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bernarpa/bernarpa/master/.readme-files/glove.jpg) to the webcam.
  * [Parallel-SAT](https://github.com/bernarpa/Parallel-SAT), an MPI-based SAT solver.
  * [FantaHadoop](https://github.com/bernarpa/FantaHadoop), to compute football statistics with an Hadoop cluster (overkill? Perhaps...)
  * [PBCheck](https://github.com/bernarpa/pbcheck), a C# Windows Forms program to check for installed software, relevant directories and executables in the PATH
  
You will find even more software hidden in my GitHub repositories, explore them at your leisure! On the other hand, software that didn't pass the legal/shame threshold is safely stored in my private, air-gapped git repo (I'm afraid that you'll never get to see my Common Lisp-based Wumpus solver, my Oberon pregnancy tracker or my OCaml tic-tac-toe, among the others).
