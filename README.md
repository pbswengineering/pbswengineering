# Paolo Bernardi | Teaching and Research

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm Paolo: a **PhD student in Computer Science (Quantum Computing)** at the University of Pisa, a **Computer Science high-school teacher**, and a **software engineer** (Ordine degli Ingegneri di Terni, member A1364, Section A, sector C - information engineering).

My work sits at the intersection of **teaching, research, and engineering**. Most of what I build is not public (work/private projects), but this profile collects the parts I can share: tools, experiments, and small utilities that solve real problems.

If you're curious about my teaching method, I'm codifying it as **Hacker-Style Learning (HSL)**:

## Repositories 🔭

I'm a language polyglot, but my open-source code is often **Python** (fast feedback, small iterations, quick results).

A selection of Python projects:
- [Photocopieuse](https://github.com/bernarpa/photocopieuse) - a personal assistant that connects to tools like Jira/Confluence/calendar.
- [PBOTS](https://github.com/bernarpa/pbots) - monitors online bulletin boards and notifies changes via email.
- [Lilium](https://github.com/bernarpa/lilium) - a dashboard for domestic monitoring appliances.
- [Hugo Uploader](https://github.com/bernarpa/hugo-uploader) - FTP differential uploader for Hugo-based websites.

Other notable non-Python tools:
- [PDF Juggler](https://github.com/bernarpa/pdfjuggler) - a simple Java desktop tool to reorder and remix PDFs.
- [Photo](https://github.com/bernarpa/photo) - a Go CLI to manage my photo library.
- [PAES](https://github.com/bernarpa/PAES) - a parallel OpenCL AES implementation.
- [Little](https://github.com/bernarpa/Little) - a tiny imperative language interpreter in C (literate programming with [nuweb](http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/)).
- [OpenCV Slideshow](https://github.com/bernarpa/OpenCV-slideshow) - slide changer driven by computer vision (yes, with a green glove).
- [Parallel-SAT](https://github.com/bernarpa/Parallel-SAT) - an MPI-based SAT solver.
- [FantaHadoop](https://github.com/bernarpa/FantaHadoop) - football statistics with Hadoop (overkill? probably).
- [PBCheck](https://github.com/bernarpa/pbcheck) - C# WinForms tool to check installed software, relevant directories and executables in PATH.

There's more in the repo list. Some experiments remain private (call it a quality filter): you'll probably never see my Common Lisp Wumpus solver or my OCaml tic-tac-toe.
